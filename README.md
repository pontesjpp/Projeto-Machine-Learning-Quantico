# Projeto-Machine-Learning-Quantico
This project uses a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) with PennyLane to predict low birth weight. It pre-processes health data, balances classes, and trains a 3-qubit, 6-layer quantum circuit. The VQC classifies newborns based on features, with performance monitored via cost, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
